Regex
   x Comment: (?#...)
   x Named group: (?P<name>...)
   x Named group referemce: (?P=name)
   x Conditional expression: (?(id/name)yes-pattern|no-pattern)
     with 'no-pattern' optional

Others
   o Add memory mapped file class

Unicode
   o On windows, properly handle _UNICODE define
   o Review all windows system call as they expect MBCS in current codepage unless _UNICODE
     is defined. In that case, UTF-16 is expected (or UCS2 at least)
     => use UTF-16 version of all those API regardless of _UNICODE define
   o Review ArgParser (command line arguments strings are utf-8 on osx/linux so far I could see, current codepage on windows...)
   o Add codepoint to ASCII and ASCII to codepoint conversion functions
       Fix4: \u[0-9a-fA-F]{4}
       Fix8: \U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}
       Var : \u\{[0-9a-fA-F]+\}
   o Export more of internal API
   - Regular expression support
      o add support for \u[0-9a-fA-F]{4}, \U[0-9a-fA-F]{8} and \u\{[0-9a-fA-F]+\} notation
      o support codepoint matching instruction
      o add some unicode tests
   - JSON support
      x add encoding parameter to read/write/parse methods
      o add support for \u[0-9a-fA-F]{4} notation
      o add option to force ascii in write method (using above notation for non-ascii char)
      o add wchar_t variants for some methods 
   - XML support
      - at read time, if encoding is not specified assumes utf-8
      - also check for BOM (UTF-x)
   o Support locales on unix
   - Use locale on unix in all standard lib calls
   - Use Path wherever filesystem interaction is needed for unicode file name support
   
   Notes on current implementation:
      - All C narrow string (char*) are assumed to be utf-8 encoded but for the specific encoding/decoding
        functions found in 'unicode.h'
      - Dirmap mapping file assumed utf-8 encoding
      - Regular expression expects UTF-8 inputs for both the expression itself and the string to match
      - XML parser assumes utf-8 encoding regardless of 'encoding' attribute in 'xml' tag (to be fixed eventually)
      - JSON parser assumes utf-8 encoding
