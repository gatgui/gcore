Regex
   x Comment: (?#...)
   x Named group: (?P<name>...)
   x Named group referemce: (?P=name)
   - Conditional expression: (?(id/name)yes-pattern|no-pattern)
     with 'no-pattern' optional

Unicode
   - On windows, properly handle _UNICODE define
   - Review all windows system call as they expect MBCS in current codepage unless _UNICODE
     is defined. In that case, UTF-16 is expected (or UCS2 at least)
   x Review ArgParser (command line arguments strings are utf-8 on osx/linux so far I could see, current codepage on windows...)
   - Support in Rex
   - Support XML encoding
   
   Notes:
      - All C narrow string (char*) are assumed to be utf-8 encoded but for the specific encoding/decoding
        functions found in 'encoding.h'
      - Dirmap mapping file assumed utf-8 encoding
      - XML parser assumes utf-8 encoding regardless of 'encoding' attribute in 'xml' tag (to be fixed eventually)
      - JSON parser assumes utf-8 encoding
